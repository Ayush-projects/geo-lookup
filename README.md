I’m proposing an Agentic AI platform for our enterprise that lets any user report a problem through a chat interface, then instantly pulls in their persona (role, line of business, permissions) and device metadata (hostname, IP, OS, Intune policy state) to build an enriched problem profile; behind the scenes, an LLM‑powered engine semantically matches that profile against our Intune remediation‑script library to auto‑trigger and monitor the right fix—capturing feedback to confirm success—or, if no script applies or it fails, it immediately spins up a fully detailed ServiceNow ticket (even drafting a new remediation‑script template for IT Ops to refine); simultaneously, a proactive monitoring module streams telemetry (network latency, sign‑in errors, app crashes, CPU/RAM usage), benchmarks each device against peer and SLA baselines, and auto‑raises prevention tickets or upgrade recommendations when degradation appears, creating a seamless, end‑to‑end reactive and proactive support lifecycle that slashes resolution times, reduces help‑desk load, and continuously learns to get smarter over time.
