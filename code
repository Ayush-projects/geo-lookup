User Request: A data analyst needs to retrieve specific data (e.g., total sales by product category for the last quarter) but lacks SQL expertise to write the query manually.

Solution: Using the VS Code extension, the analyst types a natural language request, which is automatically converted into an SQL query based on the database schema. A "Run Query" button is generated to execute the query within VS Code.

Outcome: The analyst quickly obtains the required data without needing SQL knowledge, enabling timely data analysis and enhancing productivity.
