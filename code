Database querying often requires specialized SQL/NoSQL knowledge, posing a challenge for users without technical expertise or familiarity with complex query languages. This creates a barrier to efficient data retrieval, forcing users to rely on database experts, which can delay workflows and impact productivity. The lack of an accessible interface for querying databases limits non-technical team members' ability to gain data insights independently, reducing agility in data-driven decision-making. To address this, there is a need for a solution that enables users to interact with databases using natural language, simplifying data access while maintaining accuracy and performance.
