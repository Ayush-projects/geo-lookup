Natural Language Querying: Users can write database queries in plain language, eliminating the need for complex SQL/NoSQL syntax knowledge.

Automated Context Creation: The extension fetches relevant database schema information (tables, views, stored procedures, etc.) to build context around the user's query request.

LLM Query Generation: Leveraging a language model, the extension translates natural language queries into accurate SQL/NoSQL statements based on the database context.

Dynamic Query Execution: A "Run Query" button is generated for each query, allowing users to execute the query directly within VS Code.

Real-Time Results Display: Query results are shown in a dedicated panel in VS Code, providing users with instant feedback and insights.

Seamless Database Integration: The extension uses a service layer to interact securely with on-premise or external databases, ensuring a reliable connection and data access.

Enhanced Accessibility and Productivity: Non-technical and technical users alike can quickly retrieve data, fostering collaboration, reducing delays, and improving workflow efficiency.
