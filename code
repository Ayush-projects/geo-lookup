The architecture of this VS Code extension centers on an automated pre-commit process aimed at enhancing code security and quality. When a commit is initiated, a pre-commit hook is triggered, capturing the code changes via a Git diff. This diff is first scanned locally using regex-based and TruffleHog scans to detect any sensitive information, such as hardcoded secrets. If secrets are found, the commit is stopped, and the user is notified. If no secrets are detected, the modified code is sent to an AI-based code review tool, like GitHub Copilot, for further analysis. The LLM evaluates the code for potential issues, returning specific feedback if problems are found and blocking the commit. If no issues are identified, the commit proceeds. This architecture ensures secure, high-quality code by integrating automated security checks and AI-powered code review directly into the commit workflow.
