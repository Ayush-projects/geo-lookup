Business Context
In modern software development, seamless access to data insights is crucial for making informed decisions and driving productivity. However, many developers, data analysts, and business users struggle with writing complex SQL or NoSQL queries to retrieve data from on-premises or external databases. This challenge often requires extensive SQL knowledge or support from dedicated database experts, which can slow down workflows, introduce bottlenecks, and limit non-expert users' ability to retrieve and analyze data independently. By enabling natural language queries, this VS Code extension empowers users across all skill levels to interact with databases effortlessly, accelerating data accessibility and enhancing collaboration across teams.

Problem Statement
Traditional query languages are often difficult for non-technical users to write and manage, creating barriers to efficient data retrieval. As a result, developers and analysts spend substantial time learning syntax or waiting for specialized support, which diverts focus from higher-level tasks. This VS Code extension addresses this gap by allowing users to express data requests in natural language. The extension dynamically generates and executes the appropriate SQL/NoSQL queries based on the database schema and user intent, leveraging an LLM to translate these requests. With this solution, users can quickly retrieve accurate data without needing in-depth knowledge of query languages, enabling faster insights and reducing dependency on technical assistance.
