The architecture of this VS Code extension is designed to simplify database interactions by enabling natural language querying. When a user enters a query in plain language, the extension first connects to the database’s schema through a service layer, retrieving relevant information such as tables, views, stored procedures, and metadata to build a context for the query. This context, combined with the user’s request, is sent to an LLM (e.g., OpenAI's model), which translates it into a precise SQL/NoSQL query. The extension then displays a “Run Query” button, allowing the user to execute the generated query through a Python integration. Results are shown directly in VS Code, providing an accessible, seamless database querying experience. This architecture is built to handle errors at each stage, offering feedback if any step fails, ensuring a reliable user experience.
