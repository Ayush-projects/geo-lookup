Purpose
The purpose of this VS Code extension is to democratize access to database querying by enabling users to interact with on-premise or external databases using natural language. By simplifying the process of data retrieval, this tool empowers users of all skill levels to generate and run SQL/NoSQL queries without needing specialized knowledge of query syntax. This approach streamlines data access, making it faster, easier, and more intuitive for users to retrieve insights, analyze trends, and support data-driven decisions.

Opportunity
This extension addresses a significant opportunity to enhance productivity and collaboration across development and analytical workflows by breaking down the technical barriers of database querying. Many users, especially those without a strong background in database languages, struggle with writing and managing SQL or NoSQL queries. By offering a natural language interface within VS Code, this extension reduces the dependency on SQL expertise, allowing teams to be more agile and responsive to data needs. The solution enables both technical and non-technical users to unlock data insights more efficiently, improving decision-making processes and minimizing delays associated with complex data access requests.
