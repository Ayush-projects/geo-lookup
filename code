This VS Code extension provides a user-friendly solution by enabling natural language interaction with databases, eliminating the need for SQL/NoSQL expertise. When a user inputs a query in plain language, the extension retrieves relevant schema details (e.g., tables, views, stored procedures) via a service layer, building a context that enriches the query. This context and the user’s request are then processed by an LLM to generate an accurate SQL/NoSQL statement. The extension also offers a “Run Query” button, allowing users to execute the query directly in VS Code using Python integration. Results are displayed in a dedicated panel, enabling users to access and analyze data effortlessly. This solution streamlines database interactions, empowering both technical and non-technical users to retrieve data quickly and independently, fostering greater productivity and enabling faster, data-driven insights.
